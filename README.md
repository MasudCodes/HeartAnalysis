# HeartAnalysis

Model and DATA Credit : https://www.kaggle.com/bulentsiyah/heart-disease-prediction-using-neural-networks

The model is already created in the file as you can see , you can retrain the model by running Python3 heart.py in your teriminal . 

Bulent Siyah did a great job at describing his model which i am using to build this application ( https://www.kaggle.com/bulentsiyah/heart-disease-prediction-using-neural-networks) . 

So far  - 
  by putting your heart data details on data.csv file the program can generate probability of you have heart disease , note that the average accuracy i got so far was 88 percent . After putting your health data in the csv file run python3 heart2.py

The goal is to make a Flutter based application that will be able to run the flutter code and user can input their health details (age,sex,cp,trestbps,chol,fbs,restecg,thalach,exang,oldpeak,slope,ca,thal) also improving the model in the future to generate better results .
